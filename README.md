# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Projects** repository! This collection showcases various projects I completed during my learning phase for the freeCodeCamp machine learning certification. Each project demonstrates different techniques and algorithms, offering insights into their implementation and applications.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Health Costs Calculator
- **Description:** A project utilizing a Linear Regression model to predict health costs based on various factors.
- **Key Features:**
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection.
  - Model training and evaluation.
  
### 2. Book Recommendation System
- **Description:** A recommendation system built using the K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to suggest books based on user preferences.
- **Key Features:**
  - User-based collaborative filtering.
  - Performance evaluation metrics for recommendations.

### 3. Cats and Dogs Classification
- **Description:** A classification model that employs transfer learning with MobileNet and TensorFlow to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.
- **Key Features:**
  - Data augmentation techniques to enhance model performance.
  - Fine-tuning of pre-trained models.

### 4. Spam Detection
- **Description:** A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project implementing a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for spam detection in text messages.
- **Key Features:**
  - Text preprocessing and tokenization.
  - Model training and accuracy evaluation.
